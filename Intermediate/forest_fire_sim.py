# This program simulates a forest fire. The forest is a grid of cells, where each cell can be a tree, a burning tree, or empty space. The program starts by creating an initial forest with a certain density of trees. The program then enters a loop where it displays the forest, updates the forest based on the rules of the simulation, and then pauses for a short time. The rules are:
