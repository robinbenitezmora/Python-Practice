Shining Carpet
You are given a carpet with a shining pattern. The carpet is a square with a side length of n. The shining pattern is a square with a side length of m. The shining pattern is placed in the center of the carpet. The carpet is shining if the shining pattern is placed in the center of the carpet. The shining pattern is placed in the center of the carpet if the distance from the shining pattern to the sides of the carpet is the same. The distance from the shining pattern to the sides of the carpet is the same if the distance from the shining pattern to the top side of the carpet is the same as the distance from the shining pattern to the bottom side of the carpet and the distance from the shining pattern to the left side of the carpet is the same as the distance from the shining pattern to the right side of the carpet. You are given the side length of the carpet n and the side length of the shining pattern m. You have to determine if the carpet is shining or not.

Input
The input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100) — the side length of the carpet and the side length of the shining pattern.

Output
Print "YES" if the carpet is shining and "NO" otherwise.

Examples
Input
5 3
Output
YES
Input
5 2
Output
NO

Note
In the first example, the shining pattern is placed in the center of the carpet. The distance from the shining pattern to the top side of the carpet is 1, the distance from the shining pattern to the bottom side of the carpet is 1, the distance from the shining pattern to the left side of the carpet is 1, and the distance from the shining pattern to the right side of the carpet is 1. Therefore, the carpet is shining.

In the second example, the shining pattern is placed in the center of the carpet. The distance from the shining pattern to the top side of the carpet is 1, the distance from the shining pattern to the bottom side of the carpet is 2, the distance from the shining pattern to the left side of the carpet is 1, and the distance from the shining pattern to the right side of the carpet is 2. Therefore, the carpet is not shining.
