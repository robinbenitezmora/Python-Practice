# Age Calculator

## Problem Statement

Write a Python program that takes the user's date of birth and calculates the age. The program should display the age in years, months, and days.

## Output

The program should display the age in years, months, and days.

## Sample Input

Enter your date of birth (yyyy-mm-dd): 1990-01-01

## Sample Output

You are 31 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.

## Constraints

- The date of birth should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

## Submission

- You should submit a Python file named `age_calculator.py`.
- The Python file should contain the code that takes the user's date of birth and calculates the age.
- The Python file should display the age in years, months, and days.
- The Python file should not contain any errors or exceptions.
- The Python file should not contain any comments.

## Note

- You can use the `datetime` module to calculate the age.
- You can use the `datetime.strptime()` function to convert the date of birth to a `datetime` object.
- You can use the `datetime.now()` function to get the current date and time.
- You can use the `timedelta` object to calculate the difference between two dates.
- You can use the `//` operator to get the quotient of a division.
- You can use the `%` operator to get the remainder of a division.
- You can use the `print()` function to display the age in years, months, and days.

## Hints

- You can use the `datetime.strptime()` function to convert the date of birth to a `datetime` object.
- You can use the `datetime.now()` function to get the current date and time.
- You can use the `timedelta` object to calculate the difference between two dates.
- You can use the `//` operator to get the quotient of a division.
- You can use the `%` operator to get the remainder of a division.
- You can use the `print()` function to display the age in years, months, and days.

## Example

Enter your date of birth (yyyy-mm-dd): 1990-01-01

You are 31 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.

## Explanation

The user's date of birth is `1990-01-01`.
The current date is `2021-08-16`.
The difference between the two dates is `31 years, 7 months, and 15 days`.
The program displays the age in years, months, and days.

## Testing

You can test the program with the following test cases:

- Test Case 1:

  - Input: `1990-01-01`
  - Output: `You are 31 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.`
- Test Case 2:

  - Input: `2000-01-01`
  - Output: `You are 21 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.`

- Test Case 3:
  - Input: `2010-01-01`
  - Output: `You are 11 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.`

- Test Case 4:
  - Input: `2020-01-01`
  - Output: `You are 1 years, 7 months, and 15 days old.`
