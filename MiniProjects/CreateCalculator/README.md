# Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It is implemented using Python and the Tkinter library.

## Problem Statement

Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator should have the following functionalities:

1. Addition: Add two numbers.
2. Subtraction: Subtract two numbers.
3. Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
4. Division: Divide two numbers.

## Input

The input will be the following:

1. Two numbers.
2. The operation to be performed.

## Output

The output will be the result of the arithmetic operation.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +

Result: 15
```

## Constraints

- The input numbers will be integers.
- The operation will be one of the following: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

## Hints

You can use the `eval` function to evaluate the arithmetic expression.

## Run the Code

To run the code, you can use the following command:

```
python calculator.py
```

## Summary

This project involves creating a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result of the operation. It is implemented using Python and the Tkinter library.
